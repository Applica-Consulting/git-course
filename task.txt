Welcome to the interactive rebase task.

Initiate an interactive rebase based on main, and do the following changes:

- Pick the first commit
- Reword the second commit
- Squash the third and fourth commit, changing the message of them
  - They should not be squashed into the reword-commit. Just squash third, and fourth.
- Drop the fifth commit
- Leave the rest
