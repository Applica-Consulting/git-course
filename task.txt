Welcome to the task on rebase conflicts. 

Take a look at the previous commits on this branch. 
We are singing "We Are the Champions" by Queen. We really like the chorus, and 
wanted to sing it once. We commited. Then we liked it so much that we wanted to sing it a second time.
We commited. But then we saw a fellow Queen lover, and we saw that he really likes the verses. 
We want to have his verses and our choruses in the same lyrics file! 

Rebase the branch onto `base/rebase-conflicts`. Solve the conflicts, keeping in mind that we first want to apply
one chorus, then the second. In the end, we want the whole song to be complete!
